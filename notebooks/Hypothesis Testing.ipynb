    "    - H<sub>0</sub>: (operator with equal sign)\n",
    "    - H<sub>A</sub>: (operator without equal sign)\n",
    "3. Draw graph (bell-curved)\n",
    "    - The graph will either be right, left or two tailed.\n",
    "4. Carry out the necessary calculations to arrive to a solution.\n",
    "    - This can involve solving a t-statisic or z-test.\n",
    "5. Write a sentence summarizing the findings.\n",
