# Contributing to Cary's Introduction to Python Repository

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project. We're excited that you're taking the time to become involved in this project.

## Types of Contributions We're Looking For

- Demonstrations of Python packages
- Enriching documentation to existing files

## Ground Rules & Expectations

Before we get started, here are a few things we expect from you (and that you should expect from others):

- Be kind and thoughtful in your conversations around this project. We all come from different backgrounds and projects, which means we likely have different perspectives on "how open source is done." Try to listen to others rather than convince them that your way is correct.
- When adding content, please consider if it is widely valuable. Please don't add references or links to things you or your employer have created, as others will do so if they appreciate it.


## How to Contribute

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the [pull requests](https://github.com/gregorywaynepower/cary-python-introduction/pulls) to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

## Community

Discussions about the Open Source Guides take place on this repository's Issues and Pull Requests sections. Anybody is welcome to join these conversations.

Wherever possible, do not take these conversations to private channels, including contacting the maintainers directly. Keeping communication public means everybody can benefit and learn from the conversation.
