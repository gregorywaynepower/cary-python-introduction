# Cary Introduction to Python & Anaconda

## Navigating the File Tree

- For an Introduction to Python
  - [python_101.ipynb](/notebooks/python_101.ipynb)
- Reading Local Files & Comparison of Plotly Ecosystem and Holoviz Ecosystem
  - [reading_local_files.ipynb](/notebooks/reading_local_files.ipynb)

## Topics on the Table

- Installing [Anaconda's](https://www.anaconda.com/) Package & Environment Manager [```conda```](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/) (Command Line Interface Tool) and [Anaconda-Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/navigator/index.html) (Graphical User Interface Tool) (Best practice when it comes to dependency management for Python and R)
- Picking an editor of your choice that supports JupyterNotebooks ([Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/))
- How do I get data into Python and get descriptive statistics? (reading files with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/index.html#getting-started))
- Now paint me a picture with the data. (introduction to [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) &  [Holoviz Ecosystem](https://holoviz.org/index.html))
- How do I share this?
  - [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) if you want interactivity (a little more setup)
  - [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/) if you value sharing your rendered files (less setup but not as pretty)

## Side quests

- How to work with the Terminal
- How to share environment & code dependencies using Anaconda
- Basics of version control using Git

If you have anything you want to cover, I'm open to suggestions. My previous experience with python covers web scraping, cleaning data, statistical analysis, and moving data into and out of databases.
